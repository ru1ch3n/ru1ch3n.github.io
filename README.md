# Personal Website (Static)

This is a simple, jemdoc-style academic website for **Ruichen Xu**.  
You can host it for free on **GitHub Pages** without any command line.

## Upload (no Git required)

1. Create a public repository named **USERNAME.github.io** (replace USERNAME with your GitHub username).
2. Click **Add file → Upload files**, drag all files from this folder (including `assets/`) into GitHub.
3. Commit the changes.
4. Visit `https://USERNAME.github.io` in your browser after a minute.

## Edit Content
- Open, for example, `index.html` on GitHub → click **Edit** (pencil) → change text → **Commit**.
- Your CV is at `assets/Ruichen_Xu_CV.pdf`. Replace that file to update the CV link on the site.

## Optional
- Settings → Pages → Ensure source is set to **Deploy from branch** (main) and folder **/root**.
- You can add a custom domain later in **Settings → Pages → Custom domain**.
